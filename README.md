## About The Project

What is AnimeHub?
AnimeHub is a streaming website where users can go to watch their favourite Anime Movies & Series. It uses an API to showcase the movies on our site.

### Home

The Home page is the landing page of the AnimeHub website. It serves as the first point of interaction for users when they visit the site. On this page, users can discover featured anime movies and series, navigate to different categories, or search for specific titles. The Home page is designed to provide an attractive and user-friendly interface to entice visitors to explore the anime content available on the platform

### Library

The Library page is where users can explore an extensive collection of anime movies and series available on AnimeHub. This page typically displays a grid or list of titles, allowing users to filter and sort the content based on various criteria such as genre, release date, or popularity. Users can click on a title to access more details about the anime and start watching it. The Library page is the heart of AnimeHub, providing a wide selection of content for users to choose from

### Individual

The Individual page, also known as the individual movie or series page, is where users can access detailed information about a specific anime title. This page provides a summary of the anime's plot, information about the cast and crew, user reviews and ratings, and the option to start watching the anime. Users can also find related content recommendations on this page. It serves as a dedicated page for users to explore and enjoy a particular anime title

### Watchlist

The Watchlist page is a personalized section of the website that allows registered users to curate their own list of anime titles they want to watch in the future. Users can add and remove anime titles from their watchlist, helping them keep track of the series or movies they plan to watch. This feature enhances the user experience by providing a convenient way for users to organize and prioritize their anime viewing

### Sign In

The Sign In and Sign Up page is a critical part of the AnimeHub website's user authentication system. Here, users can either sign in with their existing accounts or create new accounts to access various features, such as adding titles to their watchlist, leaving reviews, and interacting with the community. It typically includes forms for entering login credentials, registration information, and password recovery options
